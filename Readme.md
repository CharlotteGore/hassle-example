# HASSLE Example Game Scripts

__HASSLE__ stands for _Hexr Adventure System Scripting Language_ and is designed to put dialog first when designing games. Hexr is the game engine used by the [Stairfall Institute](https://stairfallgames.com). __HASSLE__ deals with dialog puzzles and the game logic. Everything else is done in the Hexr Editor (sprites, animations, maps, object placement etc).

[Work has started on a HASSLE primer in the wiki section](https://github.com/CharlotteGore/hassle-example/wiki) which will explain what the code is actually an example of!

__HASSLE__ is now in its second iteraction, becoming a more natural language type of scripting. Still not 100% sure it's right yet, still seems a little noisy, but it's getting there!
