# HASSLE Example Game Scripts

I was writing a whole bunch of documentation for this when Atom crashed, losing everything. For now, then, here are __all__ the HASSLE files used in _Holy Molluscamony_, a point and click adventure game.

__HASSLE__ stands for _Hexr Adventure System Scripting Language_ and is designed to put dialog first when designing games. Hexr is the game engine used by the [Stairfall Institute](https://stairfallgames.com). __HASSLE__ deals with dialog puzzles and the game logic. Everything else is done in the Hexr Editor (sprites, animations, maps, object placement etc).

There will be more about the workflow around building games with this language in seperate [dev blogs](https://stairfallgames.com) to follow. Otherwise, hey, talk to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/charlottegore).

Thanks!
